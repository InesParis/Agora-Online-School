                <h4>The impact of Greek Mythology</h4>
                <p>
                  Greek Mythology is far from outdated or finished! from the
                  famous and constant book retellings, to movies and inspiration
                  that seems far removed from the original but alas! it is not!
                  Learning about these myths will give you a deeper
                  understanding of all the cultural products we consume and it
                  is fun, because let me tell you... these stories are a lot of
                  gossip and intregue.

                  Understanding of the most relevant myths and how the impact
                  our everyday life. Discussions with others on how these myth
                  impact you, some breve and fun historical information about
                  the athient Greeks and why not, a bit of practice on myth
                  retelling coming from your own pen!
